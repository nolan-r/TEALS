    "    * Have students plan out their next 7 days. Suggested timeline/checkpoints below: \n",
    "    \t1. Set up user inputs with dummy functions, make sure game loop works\n",
    "    \t2. Create variables necessary to run the game, start implementing basic functions\n",
    "    \t3. Focus on the random functions\n",
    "    \t4. Figure out how to move the days\n",
    "    \t5. Finish day updating \n",
    "    \t6. Connect functions together\n",

    "### Accommodation/Differentiation\n",
    "Advanced students can add in random events like cholera or snake bites. Students can also have a list of travelers instead of just 1, where each traveler is affected differently by each action.\n",

    "The planning phase of this project will be essential, especially for students who you think may struggle with this project. Provide more guidance and scaffolding to those students that need it. \n",
